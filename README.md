# Members-Only

This is my first back-end based project, which focuses on user authorisation, account creation and role (member and admin) creation.
Unauthorised and users that are not "members" can see all the messages but not their authors and time of creation.
Users can add a secret code to become members and see the author and creation time of the messages.
They can also become admins by adding another secret code, automatically becoming members and having the option to delete messages.
Demo can be viewed here: https://members-only-production-d006.up.railway.app/
